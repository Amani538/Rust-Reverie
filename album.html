                <p>Wabi-Sabi explores the beauty of imperfection, resilience, and personal growth.
                    It reflects moments of struggle, triumph, and the acceptance of life’s flaws. 
                    Each track embraces different facets of human existence: flaws, failure, beauty in the broken, and the fleeting nature of time.
                </p>  

                <h1>Wabi-Sabi (Intro)</h1>
                <p>
                    An instrumental with ethereal soundscapes, soft strings,
                    and a whispered, poetic introduction about imperfection and the beauty found in flaws.
                </p>

                <h1>Fallen Petals</h1>
                <p>
                    A metaphor for personal growth and decay.
                    The beat is slow, with a melancholic piano riff and a delicate,
                    yet strong flow exploring moments of weakness and resilience.
                </p>

                <h1>Cracked Mirrors</h1>
                <p>
                    This track delves into self-perception,
                    looking at life through a fractured lens. 
                    The beat is slightly chaotic, mimicking the feeling of distortion.
                    Lyrically, it reflects on how flaws and mistakes shape identity.
                </p>

                <h1>Ephemeral Flow</h1>
                <p>
                    A tribute to fleeting moments and living in the present.
                    The beat here is airy with a jazzy influence, conveying a sense of peace and acceptance.
                    It’s a track about letting go of regrets and embracing impermanence.
                </p>

                <h1>Zen Mind</h1>
                <p>
                    A song about finding inner peace and clarity despite life's chaos. 
                    Incorporates Eastern philosophy references, with a laid-back flow over smooth, meditative beats.
                </p>

                <h1>Faded Memories</h1>
                <p>
                    A nostalgic track with a haunting sample of a female vocal and guitar.
                    It speaks to the fading memories of the past and how they leave behind a sense of beauty, even if they’re tinged with pain.
                </p>

                <h1>Bitter Sweet (feat. Elysian Kairo)</h1>
                <p>
                    A reflection on the duality of life – the sweetness of success and the bitterness of struggles.
                    The hook reflects the contrast in the highs and lows of the human experience.
                </p>
                <h1>Rust & Gold</h1>
                <p>
                    A metaphor for finding beauty in old, worn things. 
                    The beat blends a mixture of industrial sounds and classic boom-bap with some smooth guitar licks. 
                    It’s a celebration of authenticity, despite flaws.
                </p>

                <h1>Dust to Dawn</h1>
                <p>
                    A more upbeat track with a motivational vibe.
                    It's about starting over after falling, knowing that everything that fades is part of a larger cycle of life.
                    The beat is a little harder, with elements of trap mixed with soulful melodies.
                </p>

                <h1>Kintsugi</h1>
                <p>Inspired by the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold.
                    The track reflects on how people are made stronger by their struggles.
                    Lyrically, it’s about embracing the wounds and scars that make you who you are.
                    The beat here is powerful and uplifting, but with some melancholic undertones.
